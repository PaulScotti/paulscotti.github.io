# Is perception not under any cognitive control?
Higher cognition (e.g., motivations, desires, linguistic representations) have been demonstrated to exert top-down influences on what we perceive. The authors of this paper refute this claim (of which hundreds of papers back up), citing that alternative explanations are possible. Here I will dissect whether their listed pitfalls adequately substantiate the claim that there is <i>no</i> current evidence for top-down effects of cognition on visual perception.

This is a particularly rich paper because it has prompted rebuttals and comments from various authors, all of which are included in the current version of the article along with the author comments.

Just to lay out what top-down factors influencing perception may entail, here are three examples. Note that the authors define "top-down" as a sort of cognitive penetrability -- it is not enough that <i>input</i> is changed (e.g., closing eyes changes perception), the process of input to output has to be changed.
1. After completing a racial categorization task, Levin & Banaji (2006) reported that the perceived lightness of faces was altered. [This gets into the embodied cognition literature, which I will discuss later on.]
2. A grayscale banana appears tinged with yellow (Hansen et al., 2006).
3. Participants see a shape and are asked to report its color. Then, this task is repeated but the colors assigned to each shape is random and presentation time is shortened. Here participants often misreport the original shape's color instead of the actual color, leading to the conclusion that perception is unknowingly dictated by past experience (Fan, Hutchinson, & Turk-Browne, 2016). [Firestone & Scholl may argue that this is not truly perception being studied, which I will also discuss later on.]

This is personally a huge theoretical question for me, and I will state that I went into reading this article with a bias contrary to their claims. For instance, if cognition does not influence perception, then it seems neuroimaging would be mostly irrelevant to investigations of higher-level cognition on  perception. And I personally (before reading this article) found the idea that the brain is a black box in which cognition is independent to visual output as strange. I will try my best to objectively assess this article, however.

## Optical Illusions
As an example of how cognition <i>cannot</i> influence perception, consider most optical illusions:

No matter how well we understand the processes underlying visual perception, we will always fall for these illusions (e.g., the above left column will always look a lighter shade of gray than the right column). My desire to make the two columns appear the same shade of gray is completely irrelevant.

The authors are claiming that all of visual perception is akin to these optical illusions: no matter the internal desire, motivation, or linguistic representation of the input, the percept will remain the same.

## Re-entrant Processing: Irrelevant?
In section 2.2, the authors mention that it is well-established that lower-level regions may be modulated by higher-level regions. However, they state this "top-down" influence as irrelevant for cognitive penetrability.

> It is almost never clear which mental process a descending pathway is descending to (or if that descending pathway is influencing the input or the processing of whatever it descends to).
