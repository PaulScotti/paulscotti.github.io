# Is perception not under any cognitive control?
Higher cognition (e.g., motivations, desires, linguistic representations) have been demonstrated to exert top-down influences on what we perceive. The authors of this paper refute this claim (of which hundreds of papers back up), citing that alternative explanations are possible. Here I will dissect whether their listed pitfalls adequately substantiate the claim that there is <i>no</i> current evidence for top-down effects of cognition on visual perception.

This is a particularly rich paper because of the vastness of examples the authors provide, and it has prompted rebuttals and comments from various authors, all of which are included in the current version of the article along with the author comments.

Just to lay out what top-down factors influencing perception may entail, here are three examples. Note that the authors define "top-down" as a sort of cognitive penetrability -- it is not enough that <i>input</i> is changed (e.g., closing eyes changes perception), the process of input to output has to be changed.
1. After completing a racial categorization task, Levin & Banaji (2006) reported that the perceived lightness of faces was altered. [This gets into the embodied cognition literature, which I will discuss later on.]
2. A grayscale banana appears tinged with yellow (Hansen et al., 2006).
3. Participants see a shape and are asked to report its color. Then, this task is repeated but the colors assigned to each shape is random and presentation time is shortened. Here participants often misreport the original shape's color instead of the actual color, leading to the conclusion that perception is unknowingly dictated by past experience (Fan, Hutchinson, & Turk-Browne, 2016). [Firestone & Scholl may argue that this is not truly perception being studied, which I will also discuss later on.]

This is personally a huge theoretical question for me, and I will state that I went into reading this article with a bias contrary to the authors' claims. For instance, if cognition does not influence perception, then it seems neuroimaging would be mostly irrelevant to investigations of higher-level cognition on  perception (such explorations would only shed light on how input gets altered). And I personally (before reading this article) found the idea that the brain is a black box in which cognition is independent to visual output as strangely obstinate. I will try my best to objectively assess this article, however.

## Optical Illusions
As an example of how cognition <i>cannot</i> influence perception, consider most optical illusions:

No matter how well we understand the processes underlying visual perception, we will always fall for these illusions (e.g., the above left column will always look a lighter shade of gray than the right column). My desire to make the two columns appear the same shade of gray is completely irrelevant. Vision being "smart" in the sense of distorted output (e.g., context effects), does not imply cognitive penetrability.

The authors are claiming that all of visual perception is akin to these optical illusions: no matter the internal desire, motivation, or linguistic representation of the input, the percept will remain the same.

Comments:
* What about optical illusions that you can control to an extent? For instance, the white/gold or blue/black dress illusion, or the clockwise or counterclockwise spinning ballerina illusion?

## Re-entrant Processing: Irrelevant?
In section 2.2, the authors mention that it is well-established that lower-level regions may be modulated by higher-level regions. However, they state this as irrelevant for cognitive penetrability.

> It is almost never clear which mental process a descending pathway is descending to (or if that descending pathway is influencing the input or the processing of whatever it descends to).

The reasoning is essentially that these re-entrant processes are often ambiguous and occur "whether you like it or not" (the same reasoning was used against  cross-modal effects).

Comments:
* Is the same output occurring "whether you like it or not" a suitable litmus test for cognitive penetrability? At first I thought, well our past experiences may alter neural processing and lead to changes in perception. While occurring whether we like it or not, it is still something we have control over. But now I believe this line of argument doesn't hold much weight -- as the authors explain, experience may simply reflect increased sensitivity to certain visual input. The question then is, if knowledge interacts with perception <i>before</i> input is received, could this be interpreted as cognitive penetrability? The answer is no according to the definition of the authors, but I could see the definition itself being somewhat fuzzy.



## Embodied Cognition?
