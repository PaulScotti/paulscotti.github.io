# Productivity Spreadsheet
For the past few years I have been keeping track of all sorts of things in a Google spreadsheet, including every TV show, movie, book, video game, and recipe I consume. For the past 6 months I have been adding to a new productivity tab:

Essentially, I have a list of daily goals that I wish to accomplish, and I get points every time I do that task. These points get tallied across the week, and if I fail to meet a minimum weekly cutoff (35 points), then my most frugal friend tells me I'm a lazy POS and I am required to venmo him 10 bucks (has happened 4 times, he very much encourages this activity). I also have streaks (Don't Break the Chain technique) to further incentivize maintaining a constant stream of productivity.

Now that I have been doing this method for the past half a year, I thought I would document the data so far. Perhaps I can learn what factors lead me to have the most productive day?

I should note that I have already conducted a similar study on myself during undergrad, where I plotted how long it took me to complete tasks at different times of day. I discovered that my efficiency (most work completed in least amount of time) was at its peak the earlier in the day I worked on the tasks, and that I was least productive in later hours of the day (in addition to a slight dip during the afternoon). Here I wanted to more finely figure out what leads to an overall benefit to my productivity, as measured by an aggregate "points" system.

## Sleeping less = More productive?
I try to get a little over 7 hours of sleep a night, but that's just my subjective account of what feels best when I wake up. Perhaps I actually work much better with 8 hours of sleep, or with 6 hours of sleep. Here is a plot of number of hours of sleep against number of points accrued.

Strangely, it seems that as long as I sleep less than 8 hours, I have about the same level of productivity. I somewhat expected that getting too much sleep would lead to less productivity (considering I already know I get most work done in the mornings), but I thought that getting too little sleep would also negatively impact me. Curious about this result, I recreated the same graph given that the y-axis now plotted to the <i>next day's</i> accrued points. The idea being that after sleeping so little, the ramifications might hit me the following day.
