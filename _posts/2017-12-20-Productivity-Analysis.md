# Productivity Spreadsheet
For the past few years I have been keeping track of all sorts of things in a Google spreadsheet, including every TV show, movie, book, video game, and recipe I consume. For the past 6 months I have been adding to a new productivity tab:

Essentially, I have a list of daily goals that I wish to accomplish, and I get points every time I do that task. These points get tallied across the week, and if I fail to meet a minimum weekly cutoff (35 points), then my most frugal friend tells me I'm a lazy POS and I am required to venmo him 10 bucks (has happened 4 times, he very much encourages this activity). I also have streaks (Don't Break the Chain technique) to further incentivize maintaining a constant stream of productivity.

Now that I have been doing this method for the past half a year, I thought I would document the data so far. Perhaps I can learn what factors lead me to have the most productive day?

## Waking up Early = More productive?
I maintain a fairly consistent sleep schedule, falling asleep around 10:30pm most days. I try to get 7.5 hours of sleep, waking up at 6:00am. However, I frequently oversleep. Here I can calculate my wake up times against the amount of points I accrue that day. Perhaps I  work much better with 9 hours of sleep (later wake up times), or with 6 hours of sleep (earlier wake up times).

It seems that as long as I wake up before 8am (~9.5 hrs of sleep), I have about the same level of productivity. I somewhat expected that getting too much sleep would lead to less productivity, but I thought that getting too little sleep would also be detrimental. Curious about this result, I recreated the same graph given that the y-axis now plotted the <i>next day's</i> accrued points. The idea is that after sleeping so little, the ramifications might hit me the following day (I also know subjectively that it <i>feels</i> worse to get up earlier in the morning).

There is little data to suggest that sleeping around 6 hours negatively impairs my productivity at all. I also thought that perhaps on days where I sleep little, I also tend to oversleep the following day. On average, however, I slept only 30 minutes more. On the contrary, oversleeping the night before seems to be carrying over into the next day's work.

While these results might suggest that I should aim for 6 hours of sleep a night, it might also suggest a trade-off where more hours in the day at less efficient pace (due to less sleep) totals the same amount of work accomplished.

I also wish that I had more data from sleeping less than 6 hours, where detrimental effects might be more obvious. However, I have enough trouble simply sleeping for a consistent 7.5 hours a night and not oversleeping.

<b>Conclusion: Productivity unaffected if sleeping anywhere from 6 to 9 hours. Over 9 hours of sleep impairs that day's productivity <i>as well as</i> the next day's productivity.</b>
