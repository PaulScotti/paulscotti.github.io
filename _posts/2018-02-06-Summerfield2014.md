# How does expectation modulate neural signals and behavior?
Our world is very structured, both in time and space.

Spatial context:
If you see grass and a greenhouse, you may be more likely to expect a lawnmower than an armchair. A jumbled background can impair object recognition. Objects are also detected more slowly and incorrectly when unexpected in terms of size or position. An object can actually be larger in a scene and be harder to find than if it were smaller, if that smaller version was a more expected size for that particular object.

However, typically psychophysical experiments carefully counterbalance and equate the probability of manipulations. This ensures that stimuli cannot be predicted on the basis of past occurrences. But realistically, predictions based on past occurrences happen all the time in perception -- we enter a friend's house to meet their pet, likely anticipating a dog or a cat and not an alligator.

In language, infants learn transitional probabilities between sensory events, in which statistical learning facilitates language acquisition.

The visual system capitalizes on information about stimulus frequency, conditional probability, and temporal autocorrelation in the visual signal to build expectations about forthcoming sensory information. The question now is how does the brain computationally build these expectations, how does this information integrate with perceptual decision-making, and how does this information play into attention and adaptation literature?

# Perceptual decision-making
How does information about what is probable and what is present be combined to optimize perception?

## Signal detection theory
Perhaps decisions respect the relative likelihood of evidence provided by the stimulus given one option over another. For example, given a cloud that can very in white/black (x), how does this predict either rain (R) or no rain (~R)?

           p(x | R)
  LLR = log---------
           p(x | ~R)
