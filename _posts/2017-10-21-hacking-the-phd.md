# Hacking the PhD by Identifying Gaps in Literature
I've put a decent amount of thought into how I can best propel myself into academia. One problem is that what often may happen is someone slaves away on a single focus for 5 years and only produces marginal results from it. Or someone spreads themselves way too thin and never finishes any of their projects. The first step is arguably the most important: what is the research question you wish to devote hundreds of hours into?

How does one identify a novel research question that may be most likely to attain high citation counts?

## Step One: Web crawl the Literature
I recently discovered and modified a web crawler built for google scholar. You feed it some key words and a year range and it spits out the most related papers it finds ordered by citation count. This allows one to sort through "hot" research topics that may be the a good stepping stone in deciding on a novel research question.

As a first step, let's use the keyword "Cognitive Psychology" and limit the year range to papers published after 2010.

Unfortunately, books are also included in the list and I cannot figure out a way to exclude them. However, books a still an important insight into what the current trends in research may be. And if we exclude overly general titles like "Cognitive Psychology", maybe these results are still worthwile? Here are the top 5 results:

1. Neisser (2014): Cognitive psychology: Classic edition
2. Chi (2014) The nature of expertise
3. Gentner & Stevens (2014) Mental models
4. Wyer (2014) The automaticity of everyday life: Advances in social cognition
5. Ellis & Young (2013): Human cognitive neuropsychology: A textbook with readings

Yeah, these results aren't helpful at all are they.
