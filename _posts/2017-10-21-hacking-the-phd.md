# Hacking the PhD by Identifying Gaps in Literature
I've put a decent amount of thought into how I can best propel myself into academia. One problem is that may often  happen is someone slaves away on a single focus for 5 years and only produces marginal results from it. Or someone spreads themselves too thin and never finishes any of their projects.

The first step of deciding what to slave over is arguably the most important: what is the research question you wish to devote hundreds of hours into?

To answer this question, we must ask: How does one identify a novel research question that may be most likely to attain high citation counts?

## Step One: Web Crawl the Literature
I recently discovered and modified a web crawler built for google scholar. You feed it some key words and a year range and it spits out the most related papers it finds ordered by citation count. This allows one to sort through "hot" research topics that may be the a good stepping stone in deciding on a novel research question.

As a first step, let's use the keyword "Cognitive Psychology" and limit the year range to papers published after 2010 (because of course papers would be more cited the more time they have been around, which is not the best indicator for a "hot" topic).

Unfortunately, books are also included in the list and I cannot figure out a way to exclude them. However, books can still be an important insight into what the current trends in research may be. Here are the top 5 results:

1. Neisser (2014): Cognitive psychology: Classic edition
2. Chi (2014) The nature of expertise
3. Gentner & Stevens (2014) Mental models
4. Wyer (2014) The automaticity of everyday life: Advances in social cognition
5. Ellis & Young (2013): Human cognitive neuropsychology: A textbook with readings

Yeah, these results aren't helpful at all are they? We need to be much more specific.

Let's try restricting the earliest year to 2015 and searching for "visual attention fmri". Top 5 results:

1. Humphreys & Riddoch (2016) A Reader in Visual Agnosia
2. Clayton, Yeung, Kadosh (2015) The roles of cortical oscillations in sustained attention
3. Elmer (2015) The control of attention in visual search: Cognitive and neural mechanisms
4. Leibovich, Vogel, Henik, Ansari (2015): Asymmetric processing of numerical and nonnumerical magnitudes in the brain: an fMRI study
5. Kay, Weiner, Grill-Spector (2015): Attention reduces spatial uncertainty in human ventral temporal cortex

That's more like it! So now all I have to do is pick one that's most interesting, and have a fun stroll through the rabbit hole. Although I found all of these articles interesting, I chose to take a closer look at (5).

## Step 2: Digging the Rabbit Hole
The takeaway message from this article was that one can use a pRF model to determine how spatial uncertainty influences VTC activity, and once that becomes measurable they used different attentional tasks to see how this can modulate activation. So whenever I read an article, I ask 2 major questions:

1. What is the high-level takeaway (why does this matter)?
2. What is the mechanism involved?

An easy way to digest this is to list off your high-level points and then support them with evidence, thinking critically about whether this evidence is enough to convince you of their conclusions.

* Surprisingly, the "what" pathway is modulated by changes in spatial characteristics (position, size)
    * Explanation
* Top-down demands (i.e., attention tasks) modulates pRFs in hV4 and higher-level areas
  * Testing


## Step 3: Traversing the Rabbit hole
It's obviously not enough to one high-impact paper and have an epiphany about some amazing research question that nobody else has explored. We need to do some other reading.
