        <h1>Founding Research Engineer, LLM Team</h1>

        <h2>About the Role</h2>
        <p>Sophont is a public-benefit corporation building open multimodal foundation models for medicine. Joining Sophont means you are paid to lead and contribute to high-impact medical AI research ultimately aimed to transform healthcare and life sciences.</p>
        <p>We are looking for exceptional, high-agency ML research engineers who are passionate about using AI to build the future of healthcare.</p>
        <p>We especially value creative and unconventional approaches to research, and we care only about what you have built, not what your credentials are. You will have access to dedicated GPU clusters and you will work alongside top researchers in the field (both within Sophont and through collaborations with other institutions) to work on applying foundation models to the impactful field of medicine.</p>
        <p>We are very open to remote employees and welcome applications from all locations, though we have a preference for candidates based in the US (and more specifically, the San Francisco area).</p>
        <p>If you’re interested in working on highly impactful AI projects that could have the potential to transform and save many lives, Sophont is the company to work at.</p>
