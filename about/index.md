## Hello!
I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Psychology at The Ohio State University.

My research focuses on how attention and prior experience influence memory degradation. Specifically, I use psychophysics, computational modeling, and fMRI to understand what factors bias the learning, storage, and retrieval of long-term memories.

I am originally from Queens, NY. Aside from research, I greatly enjoy board games, improv, and meditation.
